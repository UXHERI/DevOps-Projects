## 🔥 What You'll Find Here

A collection of **production-grade deployments** integrating DevOps & DevSecOps principles:

- ☁️ **Cloud-native deployments** on AWS with EKS
- 📦 **Containerization** using Docker & Kubernetes
- ⚙️ **CI/CD Pipelines** with Jenkins + ArgoCD
- 🛡️ **Security-first** workflows using Trivy, SonarQube & OWASP
- 📊 **Monitoring & Observability** with Prometheus + Grafana
- 🧩 Fully automated, version-controlled, and scalable infrastructure using Terraform

Each project reflects real-world best practices and simulates the kind of pipelines used in modern organizations.
